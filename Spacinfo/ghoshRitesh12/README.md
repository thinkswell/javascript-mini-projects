# Spacinfo 🌠

Spacinfo is a website which serves to provide you:

1. The latest Astronomy Picture of the Day
2. The latest Mars-Rover photos of the planet Mars, which are taken by NASA's Perseverance Rover
3. Information about planets in our Solar System (some technical ones).

### Spacinfo uses the following APIs:

## Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact,
this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies.
It returns an Astronomy image with a title of the image, brief explanation of
the image and &copy; of the person associated.

## Mars-Rover Photos

This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity,
Perseverance, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it more
easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists.

## The Solar System OpenData

This API returns technical data related to bodies and planets in our Solar System,
like the equator radius, axial tilt, inclination, average temperature, density,
just to name a few. Also some major information like "discovered by", "a small explanation
about the planet" was missing, so I infused that locally with what I found on the internet.
